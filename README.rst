``gordon``: Event-driven Cloud DNS registration
===============================================

.. desc-begin

Service to consume hostname-related events from a pub/sub and add, update, & delete records for a 3rd party DNS provider.

.. desc-end

**NOTICE**: This is still in the planning phase and under active development. Gordon should not be used in production, yet.

.. intro-begin

Requirements
============

For the initial release, the following will be supported:

* Python 3.6
* Google Cloud Platform

Support for other Python versions and cloud providers may be added.

Development
===========

For development and running tests, your system must have all supported versions of Python installed. We suggest using `pyenv`_.

Setup
-----

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone git@github.com:spotify/gordon.git && cd gordon
    # make a virtualenv
    (env) $ pip install -r dev-requirements.txt

Running tests
-------------

To run the entire test suite:

.. code-block:: bash

    # outside of the virtualenv
    # if tox is not yet installed
    $ pip install tox
    $ tox

If you want to run the test suite for a specific version of Python:

.. code-block:: bash

    # outside of the virtualenv
    $ tox -e py36

To run an individual test, call ``pytest`` directly:

.. code-block:: bash

    # inside virtualenv
    (env) $ pytest tests/test_foo.py


Build docs
----------

To generate documentation:


.. code-block:: bash

    (env) $ pip install -r docs-requirements.txt
    (env) $ cd docs && make html  # builds HTML files into _build/html/
    (env) $ cd _build/html
    (env) $ python -m http.server $PORT


Then navigate to ``localhost:$PORT``!

To watch for changes and automatically reload in the browser:

.. code-block:: bash

    (env) $ cd docs
    (env) $ make livehtml  # default port 8888
    # to change port
    (env) $ make livehtml PORT=8080
